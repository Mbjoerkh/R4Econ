# How to contribute to R4Econ

Right now, add whatever you want in new folders/docs - I have to get organized and then I'll set up a file structure with one for example code (and/or pseudo code, which I hear is very cool!) and one for resources, at least. 

Other docs might come up / better organization might be by what we're trying to do. For example, balance tables! Why are there no good online resources for creating standard econ balance tables in R???
